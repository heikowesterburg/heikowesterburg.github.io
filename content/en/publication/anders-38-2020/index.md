abstract: Together with a group of students from the initiative [BILDERLEBEN](https://bilderleben.net), Hans-Christian Heiling subjected Wassily Kandinsky's painting "White Line" (1920) to an art-psychological examination. The description took place on September 2, 2020 in front of the painting at [Museum Ludwig](https://www.museum-ludwig.de) in Cologne.

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: (Text - Editorial office, author's translation) Art is the sharpened reflection of the struggle of life in a frame. Wilhelm Salber understood it as a transitional area that grows out of everyday life, makes its "hard" construction problems tangible through processes of action and in this way has an effect on the treatment of everyday life. Art does not take place in a "safe space" and cannot be described as "fantasy". Art is closer to the banal questions of life than the forms of its presentation often suggest. The texts published in this issue explore the central theme of "Hard As Art Can" from different perspectives.
