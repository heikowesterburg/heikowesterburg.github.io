summary: Dance-theater-music performance on the occasion of the 50th anniversary of the district of Hürtgenwald and the Volkstrauertag 2023.
abstract: Art has the task of entertaining us. But art of all kinds can do much more. Art has the ability to open up "spaces" in us that often seem invisible or inaccessible in everyday life. Facing Peace wants to take visitors on a very special journey - a journey that does not want to conceal anything, that takes a critical look at the current issues of war and peace. At the same time, the voice of peace is to be felt in a special way ... through dance, music, singing, theater, light installation, etc. in two places that are predestined for such an extraordinary production - 40 actors, singers and dancers aged 14 - 75 years stage the question of the aberration of war mania in the Vossenack monastery church. The focus is on Mother Nature ("Gaia", Sarah Eischet), a warlord (Heiko Westerburg) with his followers and Death (Lars Harmens). A dramatic play, at the end of which the warlord drowns in his own hatred, but the incomprehensible suffering does not end in an inferno, but ... The production continues on the neighboring illuminated war cemetery. In a dance theater, "Gaia" and a young couple are at the center of the action. The young couple searches for a way through the labyrinth of peace - not alone, but inspired by music.
